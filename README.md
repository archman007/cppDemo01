This project showcases c++ development using wxWidgets and CodeBlocks.
Typically you would read a source code file then apply changes while performing a update (inplace) of the source file or create a new file containing the updated source.

Standard Template Library (STL) should be employed.

Several functions are made available that perform various programmer tasks.
<ul>
  <li>Select A File</li>
  <li>Select A Directory</li>
  <li>Read A Text File</li>
  <li>Modify a Text File</li>
  <li>Write A Text file</li>
  <li>Convert String Array To String</li>
</ul>

Having working examplesl of this level of coding allows the programmer the ability to structure project development.

These loosely coupled routine were organized in such a fashion that a new CodeBlocks project that spports wxWidgets MariaDB Mysql++ and boost is created effortlessly.  This is accomplished by using a skeleton project as a basis for scripting.
